# S10-Barcode-Validator
This is a small react project that allows you to type or scan S10 barcodes and stores them on the program. This program also has CRUD features to remove accidental inputs in storage.

Here is a youtube video so you can quickly view the functionality and I suggest future implmentations that could be made to make the project better.
