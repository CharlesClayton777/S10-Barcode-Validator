# S10-Barcode-Validator
This is a small react project that allows you to type or scan S10 barcodes and stores them on the program. This program also has CRUD features to remove accidental inputs in storage.

Here is a youtube video so you can quickly view the functionality and I suggest future implmentations that could be made to make the project better. 

Youtube Video:

If you want to run this file yourself, you need node.js. 
Clone the application,
open it on Visual Studio or your choice of application,
open the terminal,
run "npm install" to get the packages used in the program,
then run "npm run dev" to start the program.

If you want to run tests, 
run "npx vitest"

On the program you can either scan a barcode with a scanner or enter the codes manually.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
